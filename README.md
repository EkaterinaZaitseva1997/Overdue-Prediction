# Overdue-Prediction

In this notebook there is a model for predicition of overdue for Professional Services deployments. It was made during my work at financial department because it impacts the revenue recognition. The notebook includes extract from our database, feature engineering (big part of the file) and building the model.

Main focus on wise allocation of all deferred revenue for future months.
